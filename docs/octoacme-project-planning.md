# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
   - **Attendees**: PM, PdM, Tech Lead, Scrum Master, key stakeholders
   - **Outputs**: Aligned vision, high-level scope, known constraints
2. Requirements refinement and analysis
   - **Led by**: Business Analyst, PdM
   - **Participants**: UX Designer, Tech Lead, Developers
   - **Outputs**: Detailed requirements, user stories, business rules
3. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
   - **Led by**: PdM, Business Analyst
   - **Review by**: Tech Lead (technical feasibility), UX Designer (user experience)
4. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
   - **Participants**: Developers, Tech Lead, QA
   - **Facilitated by**: Scrum Master or PM
5. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
   - **Collaborative**: All team roles contribute criteria relevant to their area
6. Design and architecture planning
   - **Led by**: Tech Lead, UX Designer
   - **Review with**: Developers, PdM
7. Identify dependencies and integration points
   - **Led by**: PM, Tech Lead
   - **Input from**: Business Analyst (business dependencies), Support Lead (operational dependencies)
8. Create release plan and milestone map
   - **Led by**: PM, PdM
   - **Input from**: Tech Lead (technical milestones), Support Lead (support readiness)

## Backlog Item Template
- **Title**:
- **Description**:
- **Acceptance criteria**: (Business Analyst, PdM)
- **Design specs**: (UX Designer, if applicable)
- **Technical notes**: (Tech Lead, if applicable)
- **Priority**: (PdM)
- **Estimate**: (Developers, Tech Lead)
- **Owner**:
- **Related docs/links**:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length (typically facilitated by Scrum Master)
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria (validated by Business Analyst)
- Ensure team capacity is respected (monitored by Scrum Master, PM)
- Review technical dependencies (Tech Lead flags any architectural concerns)
- Confirm design readiness for user-facing work (UX Designer provides sign-off)

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs

## Planning Checklist
- [ ] Project kickoff held
- [ ] Backlog prioritized and estimated
- [ ] Release timeline and milestones agreed
